title: basement toilet vent
category: house

for some reason there was an old vent pipe running up the exterior side of the house.
that was re-used for the basement toilet vent, but since that pipe runs through the joists, i have to move it to sister.
i'm going to run a new vent pipe up through the bathroom anyway so i'll move this.

the dormer midline posts have to go all the way to the foundation.
cut the wood slat finish on the cripple wall to add that post.
