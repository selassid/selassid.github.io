rob came over and we cut up the now empty fuel tank for the oil furnace.

there were paw prints in the dust on the tank... lewis?

it was slow going but fun to cut the tank in half.
took breaks when the saw started smoking.
thankfully diesel is pretty hard to catch on fire.

done!

the inside of the tank was super gross.
purple fuel and rust and water.

we carried the tank outside very carefully and poured the sludge in buckets and wiped out the rest with paper towels.
it was awkward since it had legs, so we propped it up on a stump and used a stick to get the particulate out.
we spilled only a little bit, but it killed the grass.

we also moved the old furnace into the garage.

earlier in the day rob and i went to [ted's tool shed](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tool-shed-teds-portland) (no relation) and tried to find a "dolly".
turns out "dolly" means "platform with wheels" and we wanted a "hand cart".

ted kaye came over and we also moved the old oil furnace to the garage very carefully.
it took us slowly heaving it up the stairs on the hand cart.

we did not hurt ted.
