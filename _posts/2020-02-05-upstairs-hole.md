i spent the last few days calculating exactly where the upstairs will go.
this finally let me cut out the hole in the living room ceiling.

first, i had to cut out the wiring for the living room fan and front porch light.

then i was able to cut out and kick down the ceiling.
it was doubled up drywall on lathe and plaster.
