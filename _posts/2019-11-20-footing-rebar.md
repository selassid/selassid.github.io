natalie came over and we put rebar in the base of the footings.
i had cut them into the right length using the angle grinder, then we tied them to dobbies (little concrete bricks that keep them off the dirt) and tied all the intersections.

the footings attach to the wooden posts via metal bases.
i made some wooden "bridges" which suspend the bases in midair in the correct location and put chalk markings on the ground so we could line them up again.
this took lots of measuring from the not-perfect edges of the footing holes and using the plumb bob from the upstairs a few more times.
